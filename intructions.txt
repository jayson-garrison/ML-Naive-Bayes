Project: Naive Bayes variant implementation and experimentation

Implement the Naive Bayes algorithm (varying the parameter k in Laplace smoothing; NOTE: the use of k here reflects the assumption 
that every outcome is seen an extra k times, as described in Slide 33 of the "SupervisedLearningNaiveBayes-SS.pptx" file, and does 
not correspond to the number of classes, as in page 12 of the cs229-notes2.pdf file) and evaluate it on at least one image 
(using the multinomial event model) and one text data set (using both the multivariate Bernoulli vs multinomial event models). 
Submit with your implementation files a report that describes the implementation choices as well as analysis and highlights of 
experimental results on datasets of your choice. You must include data you have collected for your experiments or a link to the 
source data if you used data available on the web.  Your report should be ~5 pages of 12 point, single column and spacing with 1" 
margins and should be modeled after published articles using appropriate use of abstract, section headers (introduction, models, 
experimental results, discussions, related work, conclusions) and citations to relevant existing research.  
Use 5-fold cross validation to determine model accuracy. Grade will depend on the following items

- correct implementation of all functionalities (you can use existing helper routines to gather data but all probability calculations should be made with code that you develop on your own): 40%
- thorough experimental results: 25%
- analysis of the results to highlight relative strengths and weaknesses of the multivariate Bernoulli vs multinomial event models, the use of Laplace smoothing, etc. 25%
- professional writing style, use of appropriate references, etc.  10%
